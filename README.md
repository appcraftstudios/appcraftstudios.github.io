# Privacy Policy - App Craft Studios

**Effective Date:** November 10, 2025

## 1. About App Craft Studios

App Craft Studios is a mobile application development company dedicated to creating high-quality, user-focused mobile applications. We specialize in building apps that prioritize user experience, performance, and most importantly, privacy.

## 2. Our Privacy Philosophy

At App Craft Studios, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right, not a luxury. This philosophy guides every application we develop and every business decision we make.

**Our core privacy principles:**

- **Privacy by Design:** We architect our applications from the ground up with privacy as a foundational requirement, not an afterthought.
- **Data Minimization:** We collect only the minimum data necessary for our apps to function, and whenever possible, we design apps that require no data collection at all.
- **Transparency:** We provide clear, honest information about how each of our applications handles user data.
- **User Control:** We empower users with meaningful choices about their data and privacy settings.

## 3. Information Collection Across Our Apps

App Craft Studios develops multiple mobile applications, each with its own specific functionality and data handling practices. At the company level, App Craft Studios does **not** maintain central servers that collect or store personal information from our app users. Each application operates independently with its own privacy framework.

Each App Craft Studios application has its own detailed Privacy Policy that explains what information the app accesses, how it is used, and your privacy controls. We strongly encourage you to review the specific Privacy Policy for each app you use.

## 4. Information We DO NOT Collect

App Craft Studios, as a company, does **not** collect, store, or process:

- **Personal Identities:** We do not maintain databases of user names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information.
- **Cross-App User Profiles:** We do not track users across multiple App Craft Studios applications.
- **Behavioral Analytics:** We do not employ invasive analytics to track detailed user behavior patterns.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Some App Craft Studios applications may integrate with third-party services to provide enhanced functionality, such as app store platforms for distribution, advertising networks, or cloud synchronization services. When our apps use third-party services, we select partners that maintain strong privacy practices and provide clear disclosure in the app-specific privacy policy.

## 6. Data Security

While we design our apps to minimize data collection, we take the security of any data processed by our applications seriously. We utilize platform-provided security features, implement secure coding practices, and regularly update our apps to address security concerns.

## 7. Your Privacy Rights

Since most App Craft Studios apps operate with on-device data processing, you maintain direct control over your information through your device settings and in-app preferences. For specific instructions, please refer to the privacy policy of the individual app you're using.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make material changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and provide notice through our website or other appropriate channels.
